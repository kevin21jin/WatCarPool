## Project Setup

### Install MySQL

Install MySQL on Mac: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

(Optional) If you want to visualize our database, please download MySQL Workbench: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/

### Clone and Configure

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/Fakevin0613/WatCarPool.git
```

Navigate to the root directory:

```
cd WatCarPool
```

Change the fields in `mysqlConfig.json` to your own MySQL configuration:

```json
{
    "host": "localhost",
    "user": "root",
    "password": "12345678"
}
````

Install the required dependency:

```
bash setup.sh
```


### Setup Database

Create the database including tables and triggers, and import sample/production data into the database:

Create the database and import sample data (default):

```
bash createdb.sh 
```

Create the database and import sample data:

```
bash createdb.sh sample
```

Create the database and import production data:

```
bash createdb.sh production
```

### Update Database

Drop the current tables and triggers and re-import sample/production data into the database:

Update the database with sample data (default):

```
bash updatedb.sh 
```

Update the database with sample data:

```
bash updatedb.sh sample
```

Update the database with production data:

```
bash updatedb.sh production
```

### Test Database with Sample Data

Navigate to the directory that stores the list of test-sample.sql and test-sample.out files:

```
cd server/database/test-sample
```

The SQL commands to test sample data for each feature R* are provided in the corresponding ```R*-test-sample.sql``` and the results are stored in ```R*-test-sample.out```.

Run all SQL commands in once:

```
mysql -vvv -u root -p WCP_DB  < R*-test-sample.sql
```

Enter the password for MySQL and the query result will be displayed.

Reset the database when finish testing on each feature before testing other features:

```
bash reset.sh
```

### Drop Database

Clean up the database:

```
bash cleanupdb.sh
```
